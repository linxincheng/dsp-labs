Data files can be actively distributed through protocols according to certain rules, so that file sources can be actively spread among network nodes, rather than relying on active downloading of data nodes. Therefore, it has the ability to actively control and adjust the security and stability of files in the network. You can flexibly customize different schemes to store and distribute files according to the importance of the files, hot and cold, and sensitivity. Make each file get enough spread to improve the transmission efficiency, safe storage status and availability of the file itself in the network.",

The user has absolute control over this data file and Access. Even if other people obtain the file Hash through irregular means and find the file, they cannot access the file itself. In this way, the ownership of the data is completely returned to the user.",
      sup3: "3. Authority Control",
      sub3:
        "Based on current application cryptography, the IPFSX protocol also supports the ability to control access rights to the same file, that is, the owner of the file has the ability to direct authorization to some end users to have access rights. Through such directional encryption capabilities, it actually brings the ability of copyright control to file storage to a certain extent. For example, the same movie file can be opened to users with copyrights according to the purchase and sale of copyright. And restrict authority to other users. In this way, from a certain point of view, it will also avoid a large amount of redundant content appearing on the network at the same time due to the singleness of the permissions of the file itself, and unnecessary storage resource waste.",
